Pepcoding pending stuff - {
-> target sum pair efficiently
-> Iterative pre, post and inorder - done
}

LCA of BT - done
LCA of BST - done

K far away
burning BT

Recover BST
Cameras in tree
Next right pointers
Largest Zig-Zag path

Done
=======

Left view - BFS 
Right view - BFS
Vertical traversal view - 2 methods(HashMap and ArrayList) 
Width - use minmax , DFS , int[] minmax of size 2
Top view - BFS
Bottom view - BFS
vertical sum - here BFS or DFS(since order doesn't matter)
Diagonal traversal

Serialize and DeSerialize of BT and GT - done
DLL to balanced BST - pepcoding

BST to DLL - submitted on ninjas(by pair class)
BT to singly LL - submitted on leetcode(by pair class)

construct using pre and in
construct using post and in
